## Markdown and READMEs

Popular repositories on Github often have a jazzy introduction to their project that shows right on their Github project's main page.

They accomplish this by including a ```Readme.md``` file in their repo written in a language called Markdown.

Check out some examples:
  - [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
  - [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
  - [ponysay](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay)


### Adding a Readme to a repo

1. On your terminal, navigate to your ```yourusername.github.io``` folder that you created earlier
2. Create a new file ```README.md```
3. Edit ```README.md``` in Atom and add a short description of the repo (e.g. "Here are some facts about me...")

### Previewing Markdown in Atom

1. In the Atom sidebar ctrl-click (or right-click) on ```README.md``` and select ```Markdown Preview``` ![](MarkdownPreview.png)
2. You should see on the right hand side of Atom the rendered markdown ![](MarkdownPreview2.png)

### Pushing/Viewing on Github

1. Save all your changes to the git repo and push it up to Github
2. Now if you go to your project's page on Github, you should see the text that you put into the README showing below the list of files in the folder ![](GithubReadme.png)

### Jazzing it up

You probably don't yet know Markdown, so this will be one of your first assignments in digging into documentation.
