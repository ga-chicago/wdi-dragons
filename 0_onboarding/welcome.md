## Welcome from your instructors

Hi there! You've no doubt stumbled upon our class Gitbook. This book will be our **living syllabus**. It will grow and become a true study guide throughout the duration of your cohort.

## Pre-Work

WDI requires for you to complete https://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly prior to the first day of WDI. **If you have not completed thisn by day one, speak to your producer or instructor immediately**.

## Recommend Reading

Prior to starting the course, we highly encourage students to take a look at Shaye Howe's (product manager at Belly) Learn HTML & CSS book (it is available for [free here](http://learn.shayhowe.com/)). Try to read the first three chapters prior to starting class; however read as much as you have time for.

## Development Environment

WDI has a strict class policy of only supporting Mac OS. Because we teach Ruby and Node, we cannot allow Windows machines into the class as many Ruby libraries will **not work** on Windows. Linux machines may be considered on a case-by-case basis if a student has a strong knowledge of the Linux command line however the instructional staff **will not** support those machines.
