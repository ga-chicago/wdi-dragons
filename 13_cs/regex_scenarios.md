## Real-World Scenarios

- Create a RegExp that matches an 'age' input value. This should verify the user has entered a valid number. You must use only RegExp to complete this.

- Create a RegExp that matches a 'name' input value. This should verify that the user has entered a valid alpha-character only name (no numbers allowed).

- Create a RegExp function to use on an input element's `onblur` event. When this occurs, the `<input>` should have the style of its `border` color changed to either red or green depending if the pattern matches successfully or not.
