## Group Problem: Kitteh Facility

- Each cat costs $10/day in case (medicine, food, lodging).
- We have a new facility with 4800ft by 4800ft.
- We must install new cages. Two models available are:
  - Free-Roaming Cage: $200, 10 cats can rest here, 4ft x 4ft in size.
  - Maximus Cat Care Cage: $800, 10 cats can rest here, 16ft x 16ft in size..
- Each cage must maintain a 100ft distance between each other (city code).
- What is the most cost-effective way to house cats in our new facility?
