## 4.1 Setting Up a Development Environment

Before we get started, we need to all be on the same page! That means we need to have the same version of Ruby as well as the same tools. Let's do that! 

1. Install `rbenv`, a Ruby environment manager: `brew install rbenv`
2. Now, have `rbenv` install Ruby version 2.2.0: `rbenv install 2.2.0`
3. Choose the `global` version of Ruby (for your entire Mac) to version 2.2.0: `rbenv global 2.2.0`
4. Finally, install `pry` - the Ruby REPL console that we'll use: `gem install pry`
5. PS: `gems` are Ruby applications. You can install them using `gem install gem_name`. For a complete listing: https://rubygems.org/
