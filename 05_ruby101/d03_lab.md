## 4.3: Sinatra (on your own)

* It is time to create another Sinatra application. This time, you're going to create a new **git repository** on Github.
* Clone it down to `~/dragons`.
* Create a basic boilerplate for Sinatra.
* This should include an `app.rb`, `config.ru`, and `Gemfile`.
* Make sure you set your `.gitignore` to Ruby.
* All you need is a base `get '/'` route.
* You do not need to **implement anything in your route(s)**
* However, you need to test your code to verify the server works (remember that Sinatra requires you to `return` strings).
* Add, commit, push to this repository.
