#### Introduction to React (10 mins)

The modern web is becoming **compartmentalized**. What does this mean to you?

There are a variety of front-end frameworks to choose from. From Backbone.js to Angular.js, we have frameworks that are great at binding your data to models. This week we are going to look into React.js - a modern front-end framework that was designed by three engineers at Facebook.

The goal of React was to create components based on views; views as in the *view* of model-view-control. Imagine breaking a webpage up into multiple elements - you already do that, right? React was designed to solve the problem of breaking front-end design elements into self-contained components. [*Prompt*]: What sort of design elements have you worked with that could be self-contained?

If you have a website and want to have encapsulated components for your front end, look no further. And, because React only creates components that act as *views*, we can use it alongside other frameworks as the *view* if we want to!
