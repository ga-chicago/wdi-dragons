## Lab: Express Generate

* We're going to use `express --css less --ejs` to build a website.
* This will auto-generate an Express application for us.
* When we use the generate tool, we can start the app using `npm start`

#### Sinatra vs Express

* In `dragons`, create a new folder called `sinatra_vs_express`
* Change into `sinatra_vs_express`
* Run the following command: `express --css less --ejs`
* Open the folder in atom: `atom .`

#### Comparing Differences

* With the person next to you...
* Take a look around for the next 20 minutes in your new app.
* Compare it directly to Sinatra.
* Create a list of 4 similarities between Sinatra/Express
* Be prepared to briefly share these with the class.
