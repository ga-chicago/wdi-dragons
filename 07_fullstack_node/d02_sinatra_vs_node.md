## Ruby/Rails/Sinatra vs. JS/Node/Express

While not strictly a competition (one of the skills you have to practice is knowing which frameworks you should use in which situations), let's compare some differences.

__Why Choose Sinatra/Rails?__
- Quickest path to building app with full CRUD
- Better at working with complex data relationships - ActiveRecord rocks!
- When full page refreshes aren't an issue
- Synchronous programming is probably a little easier to grasp in building a straightforward program

__Why Choose Node/Express?__
- JavaScript everywhere, one language to rule them all
- Asynchronous means generally faster performance
- Better _concurrency_ â€“ it can serve data to more users with fewer computer resources
- Designed to make realtime applications
