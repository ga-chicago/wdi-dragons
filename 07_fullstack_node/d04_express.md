## 7.4 Getting Started with Express

To get started, let's go ahead and add **Express.js** to our project by running the following command:

`npm install express --save`

#### Installing the Express 4.0 Application Generator

We want to be able to generate applications in the same way that Ruby on Rails can. We're going to run a command to install an Express.js application generator:

`sudo npm install -g express-generator`

We'll touch more on this later.

#### Make sure we're all set

We're going to run a few commands to make sure we have the required dependencies for our application:

```bash
node --version    #checks node version
npm --version     #checks npm version
express --version #checks express version
```
