## 4.4 JSON

JSON stands for **Javascript Object Notation**. It is a string version of a Javascript Object. Hashes in Ruby can easily be converted to JSON. In turn, this JSON can be used by an AJAX call on the client (Javascript) side.

#### JSON Example

```json
{
    "sleep": "haz sleep last night yay",
    "awake": true,
    "times": "can be had in jamaica",
    "ice_cream": "dreamsicle",
    "people": "this class"
}
```
