## Project 3 Teams

You must:
- Form a team of 2-4 people
- Select one SCRUM leader
- Select one Git maintainer

You should share contact information with your team. We recommend sharing the two primary methods of contact that you use (for example, James uses Hangouts or email primarily but Jim uses iMessage and SMS). 

#### SCRUM Leader

This member is in charge of keeping the team organized. You are responsible for:
- Lead a daily SCRUM / standup with your group and the instructors (15 minutes daily).
- Assist your team in project planning and help lock down realistic deliverables.
- Daily recap with instructors regarding project status (15 minutes daily).

#### Git Maintainer

This member is in charge of your project's Git organization.
- Create, invite, and administrate members to your project's Git organization and repositories.
- Work with teammates to resolve merge conflicts as they arise.
