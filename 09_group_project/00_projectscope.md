*When building a project scope, you need to ask yourself...*

1. What type of website will I be building? (Is this going to be a landing page? A blog? An e-commerce site?)
2. When do I need this website completed?
3. What is my budget for this project?
4. What is the title of my project?
5. Who is the intended audience of my project?
6. Who will I deliver the final project to?
