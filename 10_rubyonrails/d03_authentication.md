When we talk about passwords, the commonly used word is "encryption", although the way passwords are used, most of the time, is a technique called "hashing". Hashing and Encryption are pretty similar in terms of the processes executed, but the main difference is that hashing is a one-way encryption, meaning that it's very difficult for someone with access to the raw data to reverse it.  


|     | Hashing |   Symmetric Encryption -|  
|-----|---------|-----------------------|
|     |One-way function | Reversible Operation |
|Invertible Operation? |    No, For modern hashing algorithms it is not easy to reverse the hash value to obtain the original input value | Yes, Symmetric encryption is designed to allow anyone with access to the encryption key to decrypt and obtain the original input value |
