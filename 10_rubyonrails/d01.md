Controllers and Routes- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LZStklJAh4

##Homework

Make a dark_mart app and add these 3 routes manually:

* home_page
* about_us
* team

These three routes will be accessed via a GET request. 
Make views for each route and make at least 1 other custom layout.

Then, create a "products" controller using scaffold, remove the line added in routes.rb by the generator (`resources : products`) and re-create the seven restful routes matching the 7 methods in the products controller manually.
