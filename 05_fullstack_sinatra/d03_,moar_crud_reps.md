## 5.3 MOAR REPS with Sinatra's Songs

We need *moar reps*. Let's run through our process again before jumping into full CRUD actions tomorrow. Pick a random partner in the class (someone you haven't worked with before) and create a **new** Github repository. You're going to pair program to create an application called `sinatra_songs`.

1. We need a database to store songs!
2. Songs have `artist` and `title`. Perhaps even a `release_year`?
3. Let's create a `Songs` table to store them.
4. Now that we know this works, create a migrations that store the connection/creation information regarding our database.
5. Once our database is all set, create an application in Sinatra!
6. This application should render all of the `songs` in our table on a page.
7. Utilize Models (and ActiveRecord) and Views (ERB) to render them out!
